# Schistosomiasis Risk Analysis


This project analyzes a dataset that combines human schistosomiasis infection data, snail ecology, and environmental factors. Using a One Health approach, the goal is to understand the complex interactions between people, snails, and their environment to support better disease control strategies.

We applied several data science techniques including:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset

2. Statistical modeling to explore relationships

3. Machine learning to predict risk areas and key factors

4. Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance

**Key Outcomes:**

1. Identified patterns between environmental conditions, snail populations, and human infections

2. Developed models to predict high-risk areas for targeted interventions

3. Generated insights that can support schistosomiasis surveillance and control programs

This work contributes to improving public health planning and supports ongoing efforts to reduce the impact of neglected tropical diseases.
